    "# Numerai Stock Market Prediction \n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "Numerai is a hedge fund that invests its capital by hosting weekly competitions to predict market movements.  Competitors submit predictions and Numerai ranks the predictions based on their novelty compared to other predictions and their accuracy on historical data.  Contained in the competition test data are also future unknown events.  Numerai ensembles the top competitor predictions based on the historical known data to determine where to allocate capital for the future unknown events. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerai provides a weekly dataset with features that have been anonymized to predict a binary 'yes-no target'.  Numerai rewards predictions based both on the models accuracy (logloss metric) and on the model novelty (based on the model correlation with other model predictions).  The logic behind rewarding novel models is that non-correlated models provide new information to the Numerai's meta model.   When the novel models are combined with other top performing models the end result will be a still more accurate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerai allocates their capital to models that place in the top 100 out of the typically more than 600 competitors.  The goal of this project is to produce a model that scores in the top 100 meaning that the model actually has real money deployed.    To place in the top 100 on the leaderboard over the past few weeks translates into a logloss score of ~.689xx.  To score well on the novelty metric we would need to know what the predictions of other submissions and this data is not provided."
